IMPORTANT:

You could see more than one colour, that's because these app creates a new folder on HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Windows register. That's not a virus, it's because I wanted to change the color of some lines and other color in other lines.

If you type an non-existent command, the're would be a text saying: Syntax error.

This app, for the moment ONLY can be used in WINDOWS, but I'm about to make it functional in LINUX. That's all!
